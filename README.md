# Delivery Route Planner

## ðŸš€ Overview
The Delivery Route Planner is a Java-based application designed to optimize delivery routes for a delivery agent. It calculates the best route considering multiple destinations, including restaurants and customer locations, ensuring the most efficient use of time and resources. By leveraging Haversine's formula for distance calculations, the app accurately estimates travel times and optimizes routes for efficiency.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core language used for implementing the business logic and route optimization.
- **Haversine Formula**: Used to calculate the great-circle distance between two points on the Earth's surface, based on their latitudes and longitudes.
- **Mathematical Algorithms**: Applied to optimize the travel time considering preparation times at restaurants.
